# Viewership-Analysis-EDA
This is the Explanatory Data Analysis of Viewership TV Analysis , to understand the dataset, data type, data information, data description and cleaning my data before i start working on it. to avoid the duplicates and to delete the nulls on my DataFrame, using Pandas Library coding in Python.

# Introduction
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a TV viewership dataset. The aim is to understand the dataset structure, clean it, and prepare it for deeper analysis,using Python and the Pandas library. i have perform essential data preprocessing steps to ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for further analytics or modeling.

# Problem Statement
Before performing insights and analytics on TV viewership, the dataset must be understood, cleaned, and structured, as unclean data such as duplicates, null values, inconsistent types can mislead analysis and decision-making.

# Aim
The aim is to explore and clean the TV viewership dataset by understanding the dataset (data types, structure,data discrption and information) and handling missing values and duplicates.

# Objectives

i have my file in excle form my download,then i load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame as pd , by importing my file from excel using the URL path and installing pip for file to be readable 

# Tech Tools Used

Python ,
Pandas,
NumPy (for numerical operations)
